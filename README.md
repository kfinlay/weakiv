WEAKIV: Stata module to perform weak-instrument-robust tests and confidence intervals for instrumental-variable (IV) estimation of linear, probit and tobit models

This is just a mirror of https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457684.html . I wrote the first version called `rivtest` and maintained it until 2013. Since then, @markeschaffer has made many great improvement under the `weakiv` name. The original citation is: http://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0171 .
